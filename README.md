<h3 align="center">Born and raised in Cancún, Mexico.</h3>

🚶‍♂️ My journey began as a student of industrial engineering and a waiter's assistant in a hotel chain. Eventually, my positive aptitudes allowed me to stand out; however, due to pandemic circumstances, I was negatively impacted, and my engineering career became unsustainable, leading to a challenging phase in my personal and professional life, which prompted me to change careers.

🚀 Currently, I am dedicated to studying programming and web development as a professional career in the Front-End area, specializing in the JavaScript ecosystem. I have delivered relevant personal projects in the sector, and my perseverance and eagerness to learn have given me this opportunity to work as a developer.

🙇‍♂️ I am proud and happy with the change, especially excited about new opportunities and how much effort I have put into it.
